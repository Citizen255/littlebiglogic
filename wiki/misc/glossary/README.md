* **ALU**: Arithmetic logic unit. The part of a CPU that handles basic mathematical operations of data.
* **Analog**
	* _In reference to signal values_: the aspect of a signal value that encodes a 32-bit floating point number, usually between -1 and 1, that can be read and manipulated by logic gates.
	* _In reference to computer design_: A system which operates primarily using data stored in the analog aspect of signal values, as opposed to digital systems which use the digital aspect of signal values.
* **Digital**: An aspect of a signal value that can be on or off.
* **Direction**: An aspect of a signal value. Either forwards or backwards. Also known as **digital sign**, **splitter-positive/negative**.
* **Gate**: A logic gadget in the game e.g. AND, Selector, Emitter. Also known as **component**.
* **IEEE 754**: The standard which specifies way floating point numbers are represented on most modern computers.
* **Multiplexer**: A logic device which allows for selecting one of multiple data inputs. Also known as **mux**.
* **RPCS3**: An open-source PS3 emulator that can be used to play the LittleBigPlanet games on a desktop computer.
* **Sign**: Whether a value is greater than or less than 0.
* **Signal value**: The value present in a logic gate or one of its inputs/outputs. Also known as **wire value**.
* **Ternary**: The digital and direction aspects of a signal value together. Named so because there are three possible states a signal may have: on forwards, on backwards, and off.
