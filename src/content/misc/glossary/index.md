* **ALU**: Arithmetic logic unit. The part of a CPU that handles basic mathematical operations of data.
* **Analog**
	* _In reference to signal values_: the aspect of a signal value that encodes a 32-bit floating point number, usually between -1 and 1, that can be read and manipulated by logic gates.
	* _In reference to computer design_: A system which operates primarily using data stored in the analog aspect of signal values, as opposed to digital systems which use the digital aspect of signal values.
* **Block**
  * _In reference to loop/tag memory:_ the number of analog values that are placed into a single modular unit of the memory system. [\[1\]](/wiki/memory/tag-memory/README.md#tag-memory-core) [\[2\]](/wiki/memory/loop-memory/README.md#loop-core).
* **Digital**: An aspect of a signal value that can be on or off.
* **Direction**: An aspect of a signal value. Either forwards or backwards. Also known as **digital sign**, **splitter-positive/negative**. [\[1\]](/wiki/game-mechanics/gate-behavior/README.md#signal-values)
* **Gate**: A logic gadget in the game e.g. AND, Selector, Emitter. Also known as **component**.
* **IEEE 754**: The standard which specifies way floating point numbers are represented on most modern computers.
* **L1/L2 cache**: Different levels of cache that can be used by a CPU to store recently-accessed memory. L1 is smaller and faster than L2.
* **Multiplexer**: A logic device which allows for selecting one of multiple data inputs. Also known as **mux**.
* **RPCS3**: An open-source PS3 emulator that can be used to play the LittleBigPlanet games on a desktop computer.
* **Sign**: Whether a value is greater than or less than 0.
* **Signal value**: The value present in a logic gate or one of its inputs/outputs. Also known as **wire value**. [\[1\]](/wiki/game-mechanics/gate-behavior/README.md#signal-values)
* **Ternary**: The digital and direction aspects of a signal value together. Named so because there are three possible states a signal may have: on forwards, on backwards, and off. [\[1\]](/wiki/game-mechanics/gate-behavior/README.md#signal-values)
* **Thermometer point**: A way of counting how much of the thermometer something fills up. [\[1\]](/wiki/game-mechanics/gate-behavior/README.md#thermometer-values)
